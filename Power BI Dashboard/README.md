# Power BI Dashboard 

Power BI is a powerful business intelligence and data visualization tool developed by Microsoft.  
In this project, Power BI was used as one of the main front-end tools to present insights derived from our marketing campaign analysis.  

The tool allowed us to transform complex datasets into interactive dashboards and reports that are easy to explore and understand by both technical and non-technical users.  

By integrating data from our SQL Server Data Warehouse, Power BI enabled us to:  
- Connect seamlessly with the structured data models.  
- Create dynamic reports with drill-down capabilities.  
- Build KPIs that measure campaign performance across multiple dimensions (company, customer, and campaign).  
- Provide decision-makers with real-time and interactive access to insights.  

The use of Power BI not only improved the overall efficiency of data analysis but also allowed the team to communicate findings in a clear and visually appealing way, ensuring that stakeholders can quickly identify trends, patterns, and areas that require action.
